            <p>BS Computer Science started way back 1993 under the College of Engineering. In 2011, the College of Computer Studies was formed with two programs, BS Computer Science and BS Information Systems. The BSIS program was offered in lieu of the BS Information Management program under the School of Business and Management then.</p>
            <p>In 2018, the BS Information Technology program was born. Fast forward to 2021, the BS Entertainment and Multimedia Computing - Digital Animation Technology (BS EMC-DAT) is offered so CCS now has four course offerings.</p>
            <p>But wait, there's more, the Master in Information technology (MIT) program just recently (August 2021) is also now under CCS. So the College of Computer Studies now has 4 undergraduate programs and 1 graduate program.</p>
